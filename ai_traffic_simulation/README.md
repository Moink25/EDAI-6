# AI-Powered Smart Traffic Signal Simulator

A simulation system that demonstrates dynamic traffic signal control using synthetic data generation, adaptive signal timing, and inter-intersection communication.

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies:

```
pip install numpy pandas networkx matplotlib streamlit plotly
```

2. Run the Streamlit UI:

```
cd ai_traffic_simulation
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_ui.py
```

## Features

- Synthetic traffic data generation with realistic patterns
- Dynamic signal timing based on traffic conditions
- City grid simulation with connected intersections
- Visual representation of traffic flow and signal states
